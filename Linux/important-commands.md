# Frequently used Linux Commands

Before we start lets get comfortable with the manuals provided by the Linux dirstribution for various commands the terminal provides. We can access details of any command by prefixing `man` to that command for ex: `man ls`.
For a beginner the output provided by the `man`, of any command, though in detail but can be bit overwhelming.
We can liik for the shortest possible description of what a command does by passing a `-f` flag to the command. for ex: `
```bash
santosh@~*$:man -f ls
ls (1)               - list directory contents
```
