# Linux Neyworking 101

With Computers talking to each other over a vast infrastructure of cables and airwaves. In this chapter, I am exploring how this is accomplished, but with a prespective of a Linux user.

Every Linux box needs an interface to connect to other hardware systems. On most of the hardwares, this interface is defined by TCP/IP through which the hardware is accessed. TCP/IP offers a set of operations which basically deals with sending and receiving packets.

On Linux such interface is termed as `eth0`, `eith1`, for people who have docker installed on their Linus system might have also seen `docker0`. These datails can be assessd on any Linux system by passing `ifconfig` on your command prompt. The output would be similar to:

```bash
âœ— ifconfig

```

for your Linux machine to connect with the rest of the world this interface needs to be provided an IP address. In the above snippet, you can see, an ip address of `192.168.1.5` is assigned to an interfce `eno1`. which is an interface, my hardware would use to connect to the outside world.
