As in Docker, whenever the Pod is deleted all the data generated by the Pod gets deleted. To overcome this, Kubernetes has a concept of Volumes.  WE can attach an Volume to the pod so as all the data generated persists even after the pod get deleted.

Volumes in Kubernetes is a resource provided by the Kube API Server and we can attach the Volume by creating an manifest of a POD definition file.

```yaml
piVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt  Its the Mounted Volume from /data path
      name: test-volume
  volumes:    # The Volume is defined in the spec field.
	- name: nginx-volume
		hostPath:
			path: /data  # The Path from the Host
			type: Directory 	# TYpe of Volume for a Single Node Cluster
			# But not recommended for multi node cluster.
			# For such cases, its best to use other storage providers 							
# For third party Storage solutions instead of hostPath we can use such block.
awsElasticBlockStore:
      volumeID: "<volume id>"
      fsType: ext4
```
