This repository records my journey of learning various DevOPs concepts. I started this journey on 1st October 2022 and am intending to 
conclude this by 31st December 2023, which would be approximately 90 Days from the start of this learning journey. I intend to update this repo on daily basis with all that I learned with the resources I used. I shall be mainly using` the free resources available in public domain.

The motivation for undergoing this exercise is inspired by [@michaelcade's](https://twitter.com/michaelcade1) journey where he has recorded all his learning in hos [Git Repository](https://github.com/michaelcade/90DaysOfDevOPs) and the main reason for me doing this is to fill the knowledge gaps I have in the field of DevOps, learn them and share in public of my learning in the course of this timeframe.

I intend to write a blog each day about the topic I learned and plan to publish it on [Hashnode blog](https://santoshdtsi.hashnode.dev) and will also be sharing it on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/santoshdts). My goal is to dedicate 2 hours daily, each day to learn and attempt to cover as many topics as possible throughout these 90 days.

This repository will cover all the topics related to DevOps, But, I may skim over many topics with which I am familiar with and could not record the same in this repository. Also, I may not be learning all the areas covered in this vast DevOps landscape and shall be focusing on the topics which will benefit me in my learning and understanding and could help me in getting into this profession.
